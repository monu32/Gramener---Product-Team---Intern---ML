Hello, I used the german credit risk dataset of UCI repository.I recognized that the dataset does not contain any missing or Nan values and every value of each attribute are of same datatype.
Data of some attributes are given in range which are describe categorical values and rest are of numerical values.I plot few graphs which show the relationship between attributes which are more likely for prediction.I made userdefine funtion for converting categorical values into numerical values.Then I preferred logistic regression for this dataset because most of the attribute follws linear relationhip.I used train test split for cross validation of 70/30.I mentioned comments and heading which would help to understand the code.

Note: Download and open the jupyter notebook (code), if not open on Github

Thank You
